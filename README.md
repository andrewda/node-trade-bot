# node-trade-bot
This is an example of how to connect your Node.js bot to MySQL and your website. Feel free to use the examples as a base for your bot and website, but they are in no way production ready and need a lot of touchups. 

If you want to see the website, check out [node-trade-bot-website](https://github.com/andrewda/node-trade-bot-website).
