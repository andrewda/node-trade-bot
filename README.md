# node-trade-bot
This is an example of how to connect your Node.js bot to MySQL and your website. Feel free to use the examples as a base for your bot and website, but they are in no way production ready and need a lot of touchups. 

If you want to see the Node.js bot, check out [node-trade-bot-website](https://github.com/andrewda/node-trade-bot). There is a live example of the website [here](http://drewbits.com/tutorials/steam/viewoffers.html).
